### ✅ Code Changes Made

1. **Environment Configuration**: Added dynamic environment handling
2. **CORS Setup**: Proper CORS configuration for production
3. **Docker Support**: Added Dockerfiles for both services
4. **Azure IaC**: Complete Bicep infrastructure templates
5. **Health Checks**: Added monitoring endpoints

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 🥇 **Option 1: Azure (Recommended - You Have Credits!)**

**What you get:**

-   Backend: Azure Container Apps (supports WebSockets)
-   Frontend: Azure Static Web Apps (free tier)
-   Container Registry: For Docker images
-   Application Insights: Monitoring
-   Auto-scaling and high availability

**Deployment Steps:**

```bash
# Install Azure Developer CLI
winget install Microsoft.Azd

# Navigate to your project
cd "d:\W\Hacks\CS Girlies Jul'27 - [Devpost]\musixJ"

# Initialize and deploy
azd auth login
azd up
```

**Environment Variables to Set:**

-   `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: Your Spotify app client ID
-   `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Spotify app secret
-   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: (Optional) For AI features
-   `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`: (Optional) For ML models
-   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: (Optional) For additional services

### 🥈 **Option 2: Railway (Easiest for Beginners)**

**Why Railway:**

-   ✅ Deploys both services from one repo
-   ✅ Excellent WebSocket support
-   ✅ Auto-generates SSL certificates
-   ✅ Simple environment variable management

**Steps:**

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Import your repo
4. Railway auto-detects both services
5. Set environment variables
6. Deploy!

### 🥉 **Option 3: Vercel + Railway Split**

**Frontend (Vercel):**

-   Perfect for React applications
-   Automatic builds from GitHub
-   Excellent performance

**Backend (Railway):**

-   Great WebSocket support
-   Easy Node.js deployment

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Spotify API Keys

1. Visit [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Note your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Add your deployment URLs as redirect URIs

### 2. Choose Your Deployment Method

#### For Azure:

```bash
# Set environment variables when prompted during azd up
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

#### For Railway:

1. Create project from GitHub repo
2. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. Backend variables: `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV=production`
4. Frontend variables: `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_SOCKET_URL`

#### For Vercel + Railway:

1. **Backend on Railway**: Same as above
2. **Frontend on Vercel**:
    - Import from GitHub
    - Root directory: `TuneTalk`
    - Environment variables: `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_SOCKET_URL`

## 🔍 What Each Service Does

### Backend (`/Backend`)

-   **Port**: 3001
-   **Features**:
    -   Spotify API integration
    -   Real-time chat with Socket.IO
    -   Playlist generation
    -   CORS configured for frontend
-   **Environment**: Node.js 18+

### Frontend (`/TuneTalk`)

-   **Features**:
    -   Music search interface
    -   Real-time chat
    -   Playlist generator
    -   Responsive design with Material-UI
-   **Build**: Static files served via CDN

## 🔒 Security Features

-   ✅ Environment variables for all secrets
-   ✅ CORS properly configured
-   ✅ HTTPS enforced in production
-   ✅ No hardcoded API keys
-   ✅ Secure WebSocket connections

## 📊 Monitoring & Health Checks

-   **Backend Health Check**: `GET /health`
-   **Azure**: Application Insights integration
-   **Railway**: Built-in monitoring dashboard
-   **Vercel**: Analytics and performance monitoring

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Choose your deployment platform** (Azure recommended for your case)
2. **Get your Spotify API credentials**
3. **Follow the deployment guide** in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
4. **Test your deployment** with the health check endpoints
5. **Monitor performance** using platform-specific tools

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

-   **CORS errors**: Check `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
-   **WebSocket failures**: Ensure platform supports WebSockets
-   **Build failures**: Verify Node.js version (18+)
-   **API errors**: Check Spotify API key validity

### Platform Support:

-   **WebSockets**: ✅ Railway, ✅ Azure, ⚠️ Vercel (with special config)
-   **Auto-scaling**: ✅ Azure, ✅ Railway, ✅ Vercel
-   **Free tier**: ✅ All platforms offer free tiers

## 💰 Cost Estimates

### Azure (with your credits):

-   Static Web Apps: **Free**
-   Container Apps: **$0-20/month** (scales to zero)
-   Container Registry: **$5/month** (Basic)

### Railway:

-   **$5/month** per service after free tier
-   Free tier: 500 hours/month

### Vercel + Railway:

-   Vercel: **Free** for personal projects
-   Railway: **$5/month** for backend

**Recommendation**: Start with Railway for simplicity, then migrate to Azure for production scalability and to use your credits effectively.
